Dropbeat: Web music player
==========================

Dropbeat is open-source web music player that lets you listen to music in online streaming sources better.

We all are tired of crappy youtube playlist, horrible UX of soundcloud in which even single-track repeat is impossible.

You can search music from multiple streaming sources and manage, share playlist with standard music player interface.
